    <p>ok so what I gather from this class is that like, pc 1 sends a signal to switch 3 and then from there to switch 4 and switch 4 is like 'yo gang, look at this cool signal' and pc 3 is like 'wtf is this dumbahh signal lol' meanwhile pc 2 is like 'oml that's my name, that's me, woah this is for me' and switch 4 is all like 'omg switch 3, this is for pc 2, pls tell pc 1' and switch 3 is like 'yo pc 1, that msg you gave me, it was for pc 2, here is the Mac address' and so pc 1 starts sending love letters to pc 2 because pc 1 knows the Mac address for pc 2 now</p>
    <h3>oh also</h3> <p>ip addresses are 32 bit signals, which are split into 4 segments, so an ip of 128.25.1.1 would be 10000000000110010000000100000001 which is kinda neato.</p>
